**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **from Moodle 4.5 to Moodle 5.1**.

## Added
- **AI response language selector on the course form**  
  Added a new **AI response language** field to the course generation form (autocomplete from Moodle’s language list), with a help button and a sensible default based on the current user language.
- **Per-course persistence of the selected language**  
  The selected language is stored in the course context record so it can be reused across AI interactions (planning, messaging, and execution).
- **Translations for the language selector**  
  Added language strings across supported locales for the language selector on course form.

## Changed
- **AI request payloads now include `lang` when available**  
  Course planning, message, and execute requests now send the selected language code so the backend can return AI output in the configured language.

  Updated context saving to persist the selected language alongside context type, system instruction, and prompt/syllabus data.
- **Documentation updated**  
  Updated the README to document the new **AI response language** control in the Datacurso section.

 **Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **from Moodle 4.5 to Moodle 5.1**.

## Added
- **Optional image generation support for AI course planning**  
  Added a new course form setting to optionally enable AI image generation for planned courses. The option is disabled by default and, when enabled, is passed as a boolean flag to the course planning API.
- **Translations for image generation controls on the course form**  
  Introduced language strings for the new image generation setting so the course form remains fully localized.

## Changed
- **Course planning API payload extended**  
  The course planning request now includes an `image generation` flag, allowing the backend AI planning service to respect the course-level configuration.

- **Version bump**  
  Internal version bumped to **2025121100** and release version bumped to **1.3.0**.

## 1.2.1

**Released on:** 2025-12-09

  **Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **from Moodle 4.5 to Moodle 5.1**.
 
 ## Fixed
 
  - Fixes an issue where the AI course-creation modal didn’t appear because course view URL validation was too strict.  
  - The previous logic required an exact path match to `/course/view.php`, which failed on subdirectory installs like `https://mysite.com/mymoodle/`.  
  - Updated the detection to use a substring check with `strpos()` for `/course/view.php`, so URL variations and extra path components are handled correctly.

 **Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **from Moodle 4.5 to Moodle 5.1**.

- **Improved navigation for system instruction editing**
  Breadcrumbs/navigation were enhanced to make editing system instructions clearer.

## Changed
- **Terminology and entity rename: “model” → “system instruction”**
  Renamed classes, form fields, parameters, context type constants, DB table references, and API endpoints to use “system instruction” terminology across the codebase.
- **System instruction workflow integrated into context flow**
  System instructions are no longer a standalone context type; they’re integrated as an optional step after choosing a context type.
- **Form UX reordered**
  Reordered fields to: context type selector → custom prompt → syllabus upload → system instruction checkbox/selector.
- **Course planning API call updated**
  Simplified course planning to use the v2 API
- **Version bump**
  Internal version bumped to **2025120500** and release bumped to **1.2.0**.

  Updated README, images, and language strings to match the new system instruction terminology and flow.
